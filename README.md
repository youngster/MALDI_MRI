Repository accompanying Lipp et al. - Grasping myelin complexity: combining spatially resolved brain lipid mass spectrometry with multimodal quantitative magnetic resonance imaging

This repository includes scripts and data needed to reproduce the data analysis of the publication.

The MALDI processing in MALDI_class.py and metaspace_class.py and mass_functions.py used in paper_script.ipynb stem from the package https://github.com/youngster/pyproIMS v0.1.
The results directory includes sample lists, hand drawn background masks and the registered MRI maps.
